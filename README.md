# Project Concept
This project is a group project from my mobile app development course at Western Washington University. The project is made completely from scratch, our team was composed of three people. The goal 
was to create a full-stack mobile app project for android, while using Android Jetpack Compose. The project is a complete calorie tracker for users, users can add items to designated, view all items 
added to a meal, delete items. The user can exit the app, and upon reentry all changes will be saved. Calories are reset at the end of each day. Users can add items via custom entry and barcode entry. Many 
more features are implemented, the most notable being users can view graphs for metrics on how much weight has been gained or loss over a span of days, months, years.

# My Part (files)
I worked mostly on item entry. This means implementing the display page for items added, working on the database to store items for leaving and entering app, google camera (barcode scanner), API requests to get 
nutrition associated with barcode values, etc. . . .
